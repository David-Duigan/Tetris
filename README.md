# Tetris
Web based Tetris, made with Javscript

Nothing is needed except, of course, a Browser. Just click the html file and your Tetris is ready!
One thing though. This Tetris only works on Desktops and Laptops. No cellphones unfortunately.

Any Bugs or improvements can be sent to alexei2stukov2@gmail.com
